User stories: 

3 test cases >> 

3 test scripts >> 3 classes 


public class mainrun { 



// code goes here



}


datatype variablname = valuofthedata; 

int x = 20; 

// x is an integer type of variable holding 20 

// declaring and initializing the variable 
int number1 = 200; 

// two step process 

int x; 

// declaring an integer type of variable x - 

initialize with value 

x = 78;
Problem: you will be given celsius temparature and you need to convert

// declaretion and initializtion 
datatype variablename = valueofthevaluable; 

int x = 45; 
double y = 12.34; 
String name= "john";

// two step process 
declaretion of a variable 
datatype variable ; 
int x ; 
double y; 
String name; 

initiazlie them

x = 45; 
y = 12.34; 
name = "john";

boolean test = true/false; 

boolean x = true; 

boolean y = false; 

Conditional statement: when we put some code under condion/s, and it will only execute when condition is true 

I will go to walmart, if there is no rain 

if rain >> staying home
if not rain >> going to walmart 

if(condition){

// code here 


}

if(creditscore>760){

apr = 1;

}

if ( creditscore<700){

apr = 4; 

}



if (budeget>40000){
string car = "bmw"

}


problem : 
create a car monthly payment calculator ( car dealership company) 

Solution: 
carprice - (25000 + admin fee) + tax -downpayment
downpayment
adminfee 
tax 

finance - 32000 
crediscore - 
apr will setup - 

35000 

60/72

35000/number of months >> monthly payment 













200 dollar 

6 percent tax 

tax amount 12 dollar 

200 X 6/100

212

int x;
