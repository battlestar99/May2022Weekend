Cucumber Testing Framework: 

why we need a testing framework: 

organizing the test scripts - annotations, @Test
pass/fail scnerio - assertions 
reports - emailable.html 
data driven testing - xml 

cons of testNG - 

technial code - and only the programmers and QA automation people can understand the code 

Cucumber - BDD - behaviour driven development 

BDD is an approach of creating test - cucumber, rspec, robot 

non-technical - manual test cases 
technical - automated code 

cucumber - 

non-technical part - feature file 
technical part - step def file - java file 

gherkin language keywords: 

Feature: defines what feature you are going to test

Scneario: any scenario 

Given the pre-requirement of the test
When action the test is going to do 
And adding with when
Then the output of the test 
But unexpected output if happens 


@Test
public void validalogin(){



}

Scenario: one test case and one test scenario

key points: 

1. sequence of the test completey depends on the sequence of the scnerio 

2. the steps or parameters for step definition are complety case sensitive 

End to end test: testing the whole application flow from beginnnign to end
