Java environment - Jdk 
eclipse - coding editor 

Computer Programming: what is relation with automation testing 

writing a code to solve a problem - 

writing instructions to the computer - programming language 

java, c, python 

instructions: 

1. get your yearly income
2. divide your income by 12 
3. find your monthly income

automated test scripts: 

1. create test - create test cases 

web based application: 

Test case steps: 

1. open a browser
2. navigate to test url
3. click on the help link
4. validate if the help link navigate you to the help page

500 tests like this - regression testing 


Computer Programming: java, python, C#, C 

1. how we can store data and use data in computer 
datatype, varible, data 

2. control statement - if/else conditional, looping 

3. data structure - array 

4. function/method 

5. Object oriented programming - OOP 

jdk - compiler / compiling code 
ms word - note pad 

eclipse - write program - intelligent editor 

storing 10 in computer 

int x = 10; java - java compiler
x = 10 python
var = 10 jav script

email with your username + password 
Steps: 

1. open the eclipse 

2. create a java project

keynote: for any naming never use space  

3. get jre system library and src folder 

4. src folder is for source code - is written by you

Java structure: 

1. inside the src folder - create a package 

2. basic unit of java code is known as a class - 
java class - 
.java

file and folder 


3. if you want to run the java class - you need to add a main method with the class 

two type of java class 

1. runnable class that we can run - add main method to the class
2. non-runnable class 


ppt
docx
name.extension







Scope in java means: the starting point and ending point of some code 

{}

main method is the starting point of java code - 

class has scope {}
method has scope { }

statments: 

code 1 ;




1. how we can store data and use data in computer 
datatype, variable, data 

name, ssn, number, decimal number - 

datatype - integer - whole number - 10,100,234
decimal number - 10.06, 7.50
String - dlfjdslkjlk4543543
boolean - true, false

you want to store 100 in your computer - 

int a = 100;

int b = 200;

datatype variable_name = data ;

int number = 100; 

String name = "john";

double abc = 10.10 ; 

boolean test = true; 



int x = 10; 

x is an integer type of variable 

String name = "john";

name is a String type of variable 


int x = 10; 

creating a space to store a integer and name it x 
and then storing 10 there 


step 1: 
declare a variable 

int abc ;

step 2: initiazling the variable 
abc = 34;




datatype - java 
variable - name of placedholder - can be anything upto the programmer
dont give any space

data - 10, 100.34 , michael, true 

datatype variablename = data; 

nt 

key: JAVA is a case sensitive language 

datatype variable = data ; 

int num1 = 34 ; 

double num2 = 200.74; 

7363736 - 

String ssn = "79874";
String name = "Michael";

52 keywords - this keywords java reserves it for its own purpose 

two steps process: 

declare a variable first

then initialize
