Object Oriented Programming in Java

class - design or prototype
object - created from the class - implementation of the class 

facebook - 
username, password, email, pics - what it has - properties/attributes
chat, post, like - what it can do - methods /functions


user of the facebook - 
anik.username
anik. password
anik.email
anik.pics 


anik.chat()
anik.post()
anik.like()

mike.username
mike.password
mike.email

mike.chat()
mike.post()
mike.like()




static: methods or properties which are not part of the object and only part of the class - to call any static method you dont need to create any object or to use any static properties you dont need an object either 

static has only one copy of properties or method 

constructor: if we need to setup some initial value of the object or want to execute some code when the object is created we can create a constructor 
constrcutor gets executed automatically when the object is create - 
we must have to satisfy the constructor 

constructor overloading; there are multiple constructor in a class and the object is required to use or satisfy just one - 

method overloading: if there are multiple methods with the same name but different parameteres in the same class, its called method overloading 

access modifiers: creating accessibility level for your properties and methods 



public >> it gives accessiblity to methods and properties from inside the package and outside of the package

private >> is only available inside the same class - not available in any other class whether it is inside the same pacakge or outside 
protected >> only available inside the package, not available outside of the package 
no modifer >> same as protected




structure of a class: 

prototype / design / class 

 properties - global variable of the class - attributes of the class 
that is passed to the objects 
methods - what the object can do 

if any properties or method is static - that means its part of the class and not part of the object anymore 

constructor : if we want to do something or setup some value when the object of the class is created - 

multiple constructor in a class - with different parameters - constructor 
overloading - 

if you have multiple method with same name but different parameters are called method overloading 




relationship between multiple class - 

inheritance - 
parent child relationship
super sub class relationship 

bankaccount - properties and functions
checkingaccount is child of bankaccount - its own properties an functions - but it will also get all properties and functions 

super class doesnt get any properties and functions from sub class
sub class gets all the functions and properties from super class 


abstract class
interface 
checkingaccoutn + bankaccount
mortageaccount + bankaccount
savingaccount+ bankaccount

baseclass - 

openbrowser()
navigatourl() 

testscripts1 extends baseclass
testscript 2 extends baseclass
------------------------------------
testscripts100 extends baseclass

if childclass has the same function as parent class , child class object hast to use its own function 

method overriding - parent class and child class has the same method - but child class is forced to use its own method -
