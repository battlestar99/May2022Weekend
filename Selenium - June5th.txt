Testing Framework - 

xpath and linktext - 

drop down 

full xpath - absolute xpath 

Structure: 

Test script - code/ java class ( main method) - 

Test data - data that we use for testing

framework is a template - 
object driven framework - web object or web element - when the weblements are not found in the test scripts - when we seperate our test scripts from the web elements then its a object driven framework

data driven framework - when we seperate test data from our test scripts - 
that we call data driven framework 

keyword driven framework - 


hybrid framework - object driven + data driven + keyword driven 



Object driven framework - 

page object model classes - are java classes to store the web elements so we can re-use them 

20 web elements - 80 different 

java constructor: when you create an object of class, if you want to execute something, you can create a java constructor

constructor is executed only once when an object is created

constructor is used when you want to implement some code or setup value for any properties when the object is create


page object model - page object model are non-runnable classes created to store the web element of each web page 

loginpage
inventorypage
cartpage
checkoutstepone

this classes will have methods to find all the webelemnts of that page 
1. create one page objec model class for each web page 

2. In each page we should have one method for each weblement 


login page - 3 functions
inventory page - 10 functions
chekcout - 8 functions

object is also a variable 

int x ; 


car c ; 

loginpage lp; 

webdriver driver;


1. why we need page object object model - object driven framework 

we need page object model - so we don't have to find weblement again and again- we can call it from page object model class - if web element location changes - we can update it in our page object classes 

2. how we implement page object model? 

we have a different page object package - we have classes for each web page that we are testing - and I created methods for each web element in those page object model classes
